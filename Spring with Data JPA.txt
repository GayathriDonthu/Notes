												Spring with Data JPA
												====================
												
WHat Spring Data JPA can do?

-> Can replace all the CRUD operations with very few lines of code. (49 to 5)

What is Spring Data JPA?

-> enhances standard JPA with spring
-> simplifies data access layer.
-> allows to build intelligent spring repository stereotyped interfaces.	 
-> spring data Jpa can automatically build the interface implementation.
-> For SPring JPA to implement the repository interface, it needs Query DSL.

DSL = Domain specific Language.

Query DSL -> allows to create java interface methods that utilize certain keywords along with JPA entity attributes to correctly implement our queries.

-> Auditing, paging can be done.

Prerequisites
-------------

1. git
2. JDK 1.8+
3. Maven 3+
4. IDE - STS


Choosing a Data Access Layer
----------------------------

1. simple DB's , Native sql - JDBC or spring JDBC are best
2. High Number of SQL writes - JEE 7 Batch, Spring Batch, Hadoop are the best -> contains batch functionality
							   spring jpa is not good for high number of writes - large memory 
  
3. Data grpahs without excessive relationships - ORM, JAP/Hibernate, Spring Data JPA
4. Topic or Thread Relational Data - No SQL, Mongo DB, Spring Data Mongo


Spring Data
-----------

-> goal is to work with variety of persistence stores

Spring Data Commons artifact -> Repository
							 -> Cross - store persistence
							 -> Dynamic query generation
							 
-> spring has 9 data access implementations, spring data jpa is one of those.

Getting started
---------------

https://github.com/dlbunker/ps-guitar-db

-> This project is a database that holds guitar manufacturers and models and types of guitars they make.
-> uses standard JPA with H2 embedded database
